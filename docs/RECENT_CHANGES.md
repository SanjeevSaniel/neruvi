  - **Improved grid layout:** Changed from 3-column to 2-column layout for better visual balance
  - **Popular topics functionality:** Confirmed click-to-start-conversation feature is working

### 5. **Source Reference System Overhaul**
- **Files Modified:** `route.ts` (API), `SourcePanel.tsx`, `MessageBubble.tsx`
- **Changes:**
  - **Stricter relevance filtering:**
    - API: Increased threshold from 0.3 to 0.7 (70% relevance minimum)
    - Limited to top 2 most relevant results instead of 5
    - Improved deduplication: 60-second window instead of 30-second
  - **Frontend filtering:**
    - SourcePanel: Only displays sources with ≥60% relevance
    - Returns null if no high-quality sources exist
    - MessageBubble: Shows accurate count of filtered sources only
  - **Result:** Users now see only the most relevant, exact timestamps instead of multiple unnecessary references

### 6. **Technical Improvements**
- **Performance:** Reduced API calls by limiting source results to 2 highest-relevance matches
- **User Experience:** Eliminated confusion from showing low-relevance or duplicate timestamps
- **Visual Consistency:** All components now use consistent green theme colors
- **Accessibility:** Improved contrast ratios with better text colors
